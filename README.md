## building

```
git clone https://github.com/mikedesu/raylib-rpg
cd raylib-rpg
make
```

-----

## running

While still in the `raylib-rpg` folder, you need to make sure you have the current assets. 
The following commands will:

1. download the `projectrpg-img.zip` file
2. unzip the file to reveal an `img` directory as well as several `*_textures.txt` files.
3. run the game

```
wget https://www.evildojo.com/projectrpg-img.zip
unzip projectrpg-img.zip
./game
```

Of course, if you've already grabbed the assets, you can just:

```
./game
```
