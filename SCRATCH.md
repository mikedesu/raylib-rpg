no talking just coding
refactoring in progress...

---------------------------------------

i can update this file so that my 
thoughts appear on-screen while 
streaming or making videos
this way the viewer can be informed 
as to what im doing at certain points 
if it isnt clear

it would also help me keep organized
in case i get distracted or rabbit-hole
down some innocuous detail

there is a limit to how much i can
fit on the screen realistically
and when updating this file
i should turn copilot off
