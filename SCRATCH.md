no talking just coding
refactoring in progress...

implementing code hot swapping

- want to start converting existing classes
into structs so that I can start using 
code hot-swapping (the class mangling
is a big deal)

- convert class into struct
- convert class methods into functions
    - put the `smart_ptr` to the struct 
    as the first argument
