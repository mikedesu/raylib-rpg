no talking just coding
refactoring in progress...

---------------------------------------

implementing code hot swapping

- want to start converting existing classes
into structs so that I can start using 
code hot-swapping (the class mangling
is a big deal)

- convert class into struct
- convert class methods into functions
    - put the reference -OR- `smart_ptr` 
    to the struct as the first argument

### BEFORE CONTINUING TO NEXT CLASS

- fix the bug with drawing and scale
    - default scale looks okay but
    zooming in the sprites are
    drawing at the old size
    the tiles are correct tho

Taking a break for tonight!
Thank you for watching <3
