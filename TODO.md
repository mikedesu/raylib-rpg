# TODO

- [ ] smooth animations during movement
    - [ ] will require a "world-step" function that allows us to register events every turn and then process them
- [ ] a nice "fire" sprite
- [ ] sokoban-style block pushing
- [ ] switches that turn on and off by weight and can be attached to some other functionality
- [ ] doors
- [ ] trap tiles
- [ ] the tiles have to be displayed in such a way as that, if a tile type were to change, its associated display also changes
- [ ] message log / event log
