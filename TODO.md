# TODO

- [ ] smooth animations during movement
    - [ ] will require a "world-step" function that allows us to register events every turn and then process them

- [ ] switches that turn on and off by weight and can be attached to some other functionality
- [ ] doors

- [x] message log / event log
    - [ ] this needs to be greatly re-vamped
    - [ ] the HUD and message log need to be separated
    - [ ] the message log will need to be re-structured in such a way that
        - [ ] the text rendered is based off of structured message-objects that contain specific information about
            - [ ] which entity performed the action
            - [ ] what location the action was performed at
            - [ ] what action was performed or what event occured
                - [ ] example: mike attacks a goblin, goblin takes 5 damage

- [ ] word-wrapping for the message log
    - [ ] flexible HUD that can be resized
- [ ] flexible dungeon generation
- [ ] a way to save and load the game

- [ ] apply optional dithering to textures read in, not just on tiles
