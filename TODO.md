# TODO

- [ ] smooth animations during movement
    - [ ] will require a "world-step" function that allows us to register events every turn and then process them
- [ ] a nice "fire" sprite
- [ ] sokoban-style block pushing
- [ ] switches that turn on and off by weight and can be attached to some other functionality
- [ ] doors
- [ ] trap tiles
- [x] the tiles have to be displayed in such a way as that, if a tile type were to change, its associated display also changes
- [ ] HUDPane similar to MessagePane
- [ ] Generic Pane / some way to genericize text windows / popup information / better PopupManagement
- [ ] Inventory
- [ ] ActionContextMenu similar to Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy Tactics
- [x] message log / event log
    - [ ] this needs to be greatly re-vamped
    - [x] the HUD and message log need to be separated
    - [x] the message log will need to be re-structured in such a way that
        - [x] the text rendered is based off of structured message-objects that contain specific information about
            - [ ] which entity performed the action
            - [ ] what location the action was performed at
            - [ ] what action was performed or what event occured
                - [ ] example: mike attacks a goblin, goblin takes 5 damage
- [x] place enemies on tiles / spawn them
- [x] be able to bump into enemies/entities
- [ ] make enemy sprite sheets with 3 directions, up, down, right
    - [ ] goblin
    - [ ] bat
    - [ ] slime
    - [ ] cat
    - [ ] eyeball
- [x] a dynamic camera that follows the player
- [ ] a dynamic sprite system that allows for a humanoid body and equipping individual weapons/armor
    - [ ] left arm
    - [ ] right arm
    - [ ] head
    - [ ] torso
    - [ ] legs
    - [ ] feet
    - [ ] left hand
    - [ ] right hand
    - [ ] left ring
    - [ ] right ring
- [ ] have enemies move randomly
- [ ] have enemies move towards the player
- [x] torches / item placement on tiles
- [x] dynamic lighting via torches
- [ ] be able to pick-up items and have them in your inventory
- [x] re-do how we manage entities in the dungeon
    - [x] currently, we are storing the dungeon x,y on each sprite
    - [x] we want to be able to look at each tile and determine what is on it easily
- [ ] word-wrapping for the message log
    - [ ] flexible HUD that can be resized
- [ ] flexible dungeon generation
- [ ] a way to save and load the game
- [ ] a way to pause the game
- [x] a way to quit the game
- [ ] a context menu for performing actions
- [x] mouse-click select tile
    - [x] translate mouse-click on screen into in world x,y
    - [x] translate world x,y into dungeon tile x,y
    - [ ] make the select tile draw occur after all other drawing (optional?)
    - [ ] make the select tile actually draw a box around any entity that is on the tile
    - [ ] **TODO** fix the bug that is causing the "last tile clicked" to change locations when zooming in and out
- [ ] apply optional dithering to textures read in, not just on tiles
- [x] add an additional control-mode that will allow for tile selection without the mouse
    - [x] add the new control-mode to the enum
    - [x] handle the control-mode switch (there are 3 now)
    - [x] handle the new control-mode
- [x] there is a bug in tile-selection mode involving torches
    - [x] laying a torch down is not increasing the lighting
    - [x] lighting increase needs to be done at the end of `spawn_torch`
- [x] need to wrap-up the code to remove torches in the same way as `spawn_torch`
- [ ] might be a good time to migrate all of the Vector2 code related to dungeon position to an integer-based data structure
- [ ] eliminate dependencies on `sprite_type` 
- [ ] remove the dependencies on `sprite_type` in favor of `entity_type`
- [ ] type-naming should be re-done, e.g. `entity_type` would become `EntityType` to better integrate with raylib struct naming
- [ ] considering re-sizing tiles for higher-resolution sprites
- [x] re-position player sprite on tile to be more within the tile to help eliminate some issues with drawing taller sprites
    - [ ] we should be able to figure out how to properly shade/shadow/darken sprites when on an unlit tile or have no light source themselves
- [ ] separate out the logic for "light_level" and "lighting distance" because they are currently bound together
- [ ] add player name to the log messages
- [ ] camera position needs an offset update on zoom in order to keep the player centered
    - [ ] need a function "center cam on player"
- [ ] when we enter "cursor" mode, we want the cursor to default to the player's location
- [ ] tile entities need to be unique to a set. vector allows for duplicates.
